  	 <div><h3>Here is my Recipe for my cup of Milk Tea</h3></div>
  	 <ol>
  	 	<li>Firstly it varies based on what I have with me. I usually use boiling water and tea bags (usually 2 tea bags minimum for stronger flavor) to simmer my tea. In Bangladesh, people usually simmer the tea leaves in a boiling pot with boiling water but I mainly use tea bags for convenience</li>
     	<li>I then use either condensed milk or creamer. I sometimes used dehydrated milk and just milk in general but then I would do a optional third step</li>
   	    <li>This step is optional in case your milk does not have a sweetner, in this case, I either use sugar or honey</li>
        <li>Now we stir everything and wait 10 minutes, after which we enjoyed after freshly made morning cup of tea :)</li>
